CodeConnect is a specialized peer learning and social activity platform designed for developers and competitive coders. It bridges the gap between solitary problem solving and community growth by aggregating coding activity from multiple platforms into a single, cohesive feed.

## 🚀 Overview

CodeConnect allows users to link their profiles from popular platforms like **LeetCode**, **Codeforces**, and **GitHub**. Whenever a user solves a problem, it is automatically shared as an activity, allowing friends and community members to track progress, discuss solutions, and stay motivated.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Multi-Platform Sync:** Connect your LeetCode, Codeforces, and GitHub accounts to automatically sync your latest submissions.
- **Unified Activity Feed:** See what your peers are solving in real-time. Like, comment, and share insights on specific coding problems.
- **Global & Peer Leaderboards:** Compete with friends or climb the global ranks based on problem difficulty and consistency.
- **Localized Communities:** Join specialized groups (e.g., "Algorithm Masters", "React Enthusiasts") to deep-dive into specific technologies or prep for interviews.
- **Direct Messaging:** Collaborate with friends on tough problems via the built-in messenger.
- **Comprehensive Profile:** Showcase your total solved count, global rank, and coding streak across all connected platforms.
