# CodeConnect

**CodeConnect** is a specialized peer learning and social activity platform for developers and competitive coders. It bridges the gap between solitary problem solving and community growth by aggregating coding activity from multiple platforms into a single, cohesive feed.

---

## 🚀 Overview

CodeConnect allows users to link profiles from platforms like **LeetCode**, **Codeforces**, and **GitHub**. Whenever a user solves a problem, it’s automatically shared as an activity, allowing friends and the community to track progress, discuss solutions, and stay motivated.
