Name of project: Codeconnect

This project is a peer learning and coding activity platform.
Users connect their coding profiles (like Codeforces or LeetCode) to the website.
Whenever someone solves a coding problem, it automatically shows up as an activity that others can see.
This helps friends track each other’s progress, stay motivated, and avoid repeating the same problems.
